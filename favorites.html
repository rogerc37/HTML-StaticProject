        <p>I can swim so thats pretty cool. not sure where the practical use is there unless i wanna be like a diver for a living or like i fall off a boat. also getting wrinkly skin after swimming is <span class="red">AWFUL</span> and its always so <span class="red">cold</span> when you get out of a pool <span class="red">2/10</span> would not recommend. heres a cool image of water im not dumb enough to bring my phone into the place with chlorine water also this is just a random picture</p>
